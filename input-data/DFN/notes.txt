Content: Notes on the data contained in these files. All drive cycles were simulated according to the following details:

-- Model: DFN (CasADi implementation from Bosch Project)
-- Parameter Set: NCA (Used in Bosch project), 2019-4-24
-- Rc value = 0
-- V0 = {3.9481 3.7689 3.5982 3.4562}
-- T_amb = 25C
-- **** Current in the .mat file is NOT normalized by area (as required in DFN / SPMeT?) and follows the following sign convention:
		-- (-) <--> Discharge & (+) Charge
		-- Note that this is the OPPOSITE of what the model does; hence in the DFN/SPMeT when current is loaded the sign is flipped
